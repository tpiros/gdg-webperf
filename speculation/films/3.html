      "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the third film in the Harry Potter series,
      directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, dives deeper into the magical world with more mature themes. The
      story begins with Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which is
      overshadowed by the news that Sirius Black, a notorious prisoner, has escaped from Azkaban
      prison. Sirius is believed to have been a close ally of the dark wizard Voldemort and is
      suspected of betraying Harry's parents, leading to their murder.

      As Hogwarts is guarded by the eerie Dementors, the prison guards of Azkaban sent to capture
      Black, Harry encounters them and is significantly affected by their power to consume a
      person's happiness. Meanwhile, Harry learns more about his past and his connection to Sirius
      Black through new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, who teaches Harry how to
      defend himself against the Dementors.

      The story takes a twist when Harry discovers that Sirius Black is actually his godfather and
      was wrongly accused of the betrayal. The real traitor is revealed to be Peter Pettigrew, who
      had been hiding as Ron Weasley's pet rat. With the help of Hermione Granger's time-turner,
      Harry and Hermione travel back in time to save Sirius from a grave injustice and also rescue
      the magical creature Buckbeak.

      "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" explores themes of identity, the past's influence
      on the present, and the complexity of human nature. It is notable for its darker tone and more
      complex storytelling, as Harry faces the duality of human nature and the realization that not
      everything is as black and white as it seems. The film ends with Sirius escaping to go into
      hiding, Lupin resigning from Hogwarts after his werewolf nature is revealed, and Harry finding
      a semblance of family in his godfather.
