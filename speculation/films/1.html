      "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (released as "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
      Stone" in some regions) is the first film in the Harry Potter series, directed by Chris
      Columbus. It tells the story of Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old boy who discovers he is a
      wizard on his eleventh birthday. Harry, who has been living a mundane and sometimes miserable
      life with his uncaring relatives, the Dursleys, is whisked away to Hogwarts School of
      Witchcraft and Wizardry by Hagrid, the groundskeeper.

      At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends, learns about his famous past and his connection to the dark
      wizard Voldemort, who killed his parents but somehow failed to kill him as a baby. Harry,
      along with his new friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, uncovers the mystery of the
      Philosopher's Stone, an alchemical substance with the power to grant immortality, which is
      being sought by Voldemort to restore himself to power.

      The trio faces various magical challenges and creatures, including a three-headed dog, a
      deadly plant, and a life-sized game of wizard's chess. Their courage, friendship, and skills
      are put to the test as they strive to prevent the Stone from falling into the wrong hands. The
      film concludes with Harry thwarting Voldemort's attempt to return to power, for now, deepening
      the enmity between them and setting the stage for the ongoing saga.
